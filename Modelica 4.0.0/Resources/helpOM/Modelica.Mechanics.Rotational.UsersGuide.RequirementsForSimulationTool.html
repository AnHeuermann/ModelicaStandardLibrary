<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This library is designed in a fully object oriented way in order
that components can be connected together in every meaningful
combination (e.g., direct connection of two springs or two
inertias). As a consequence, most models lead to a system of
differential-algebraic equations (DAE) of
<strong>index 3</strong> (= constraint equations have to be
differentiated twice in order to arrive at a state space
representation) and the Modelica translator or the simulator has to
cope with this system representation. According to our present
knowledge, this requires that the Modelica translator is able to
symbolically differentiate equations (otherwise it is e.g., not
possible to provide consistent initial conditions; even if
consistent initial conditions are present, most numerical DAE
integrators can cope at most with index 2 DAEs).</p>
<p>The elements of this library can be connected together in an
arbitrary way. However, difficulties may occur, if the elements
which can <strong>lock</strong> the <strong>relative
motion</strong> between two flanges are connected
<strong>rigidly</strong> together such that essentially the
<strong>same relative motion</strong> can be locked. The reason is
that the cut-torque in the locked phase is not uniquely defined if
the elements are locked at the same time instant (i.e., there does
not exist a unique solution) and some simulation systems may not be
able to handle this situation, since this leads to a singularity
during simulation. Currently, this type of problem can occur with
the Coulomb friction elements such as
<strong>BearingFriction</strong>, <strong>Clutch</strong>,
<strong>Brake</strong> or <strong>LossyGear</strong> when the
elements become stuck:</p>

<p>In the figure above, two typical situations are shown: In the
upper part of the figure, the series connection of rigidly attached
<code>bearingFriction1</code> and <code>clutch</code> components
are shown. This does not hurt, because the
<code>bearingFriction1</code> element can lock the relative motion
between the element and the housing (<code>fixed1</code>), whereas
the clutch element can lock the relative motion between the two
connected flanges. On the contrary, the drive train in the lower
part of the figure may give rise to simulation problems, because
the <code>bearingFriction2</code> element and the
<code>brake</code> element can lock the relative motion between a
flange and the housing and these flanges are rigidly connected
together, i.e., essentially the same relative motion can be locked.
These difficulties may be solved by either introducing a compliance
between these flanges or by combining the bearing friction and
brake element into one component and resolving the ambiguity of the
frictional torque in the stuck mode of that component. A tool may
handle this situation also <strong>automatically</strong>, by
picking one solution of the infinitely many, e.g., the one where
the difference to the value of the previous time instant is as
small as possible.</p>
