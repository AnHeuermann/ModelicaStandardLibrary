<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This package contains components to model <strong>1-dimensional
translational mechanical</strong> systems, including different
types of masses, external forces, spring/damper elements,
frictional elements, elastogaps, elements to measure position,
velocity, acceleration or the cut-force of a flange. In sublibrary
<strong><a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Examples.html">Examples</a></strong>
several examples are present to demonstrate the usage of the
elements. Just open the corresponding example model and simulate
the model according to the provided description.</p>
<p>A unique feature of this library is the
<strong>component-oriented</strong> modeling of <strong>Coulomb
friction</strong> elements, such as support friction. Even
(dynamically) coupled friction elements can be handled
<strong>without</strong> introducing stiffness, which leads to fast
simulations. The underlying theory is based on the solution of
mixed continuous/discrete systems of equations, i.e., equations
where the <strong>unknowns</strong> are of type
<strong>Real</strong>, <strong>Integer</strong> or
<strong>Boolean</strong>. Provided appropriate numerical algorithms
for the solution of such types of systems are available in the
simulation tool, the simulation of (dynamically) coupled friction
elements of this library is <strong>efficient</strong> and
<strong>reliable</strong>.</p>

<p>A simple example of the usage of this library is given in the
figure above. This model consists of a <code>mass1</code> with mass
<var>m</var> = 1 kg which is connected via a spring
to a <code>mass2</code> with mass
<var>m</var> = 5 kg. The left mass is driven via an
external, sinusoidal force. The <strong>filled</strong> and
<strong>non-filled green squares</strong> at the left and right
side of a component represent <strong>mechanical flanges</strong>.
Drawing a line between such squares means that the corresponding
flanges are <strong>rigidly attached</strong> to each other. By
convention in this library, the connector characterized as a
<strong>filled</strong> green square is called
<strong>flange_a</strong> and placed at the left side of the
component in the "design view" and the connector characterized as a
<strong>non-filled</strong> green square is called
<strong>flange_b</strong> and placed at the right side of the
component in the "design view". The two connectors are completely
<strong>identical</strong>, with the only exception that the
graphical layout is a little bit different in order to distinguish
them for easier access of the connector variables. For example,
<code>mass1.flange_a.f</code> is the cut-force in the connector
<code>flange_a</code> of component <code>mass1</code>.</p>
<p>The components of this library can be <strong>connected</strong>
together in an <strong>arbitrary</strong> way. E.g., it is possible
to connect two springs or two shafts with mass directly together,
see figure below.</p>
