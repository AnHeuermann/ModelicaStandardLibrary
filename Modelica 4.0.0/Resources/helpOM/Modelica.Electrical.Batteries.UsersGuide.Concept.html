<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>The core of the cell models is a <a href="Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Sources.SignalVoltage.html">signal
voltage</a> controlled by a look-up table OCV (open circuit
voltage) dependent on SOC (state of charge).<br/>
However, other dependencies (e.g., on temperature) are not
implemented yet.</p>
<p>Current flowing to or from the battery is measured and
integrated, thus calculating the charge contained in the battery.
The charge contained in the battery with respect to nominal charge
<code>Qnom</code> gives SOC.<br/>
The look-up table is parameterized for one cell, therefore input
has to be scaled by <code>1/(Np*Qnom)</code>, and the output has to
be scaled by <code>Ns*OCVmax</code>.</p>
<p>To model self-discharge, a conductor in parallel to the signal
voltage and the current sensor is implemented. If self-discharge is
specified as zero, the conductor is omitted.</p>
<p>A resistor <code>r0</code> is connected in series to the signal
voltage, representing the inner resistance of the battery. The
resistance can be specified as linearly dependent on
temperature.</p>
<p>If <a href="Modelica.Electrical.Batteries.BatteryStacks.CellRCStack.html">
CellRCStack</a> instead of <a href="Modelica.Electrical.Batteries.BatteryStacks.CellStack.html">CellStack</a>
is chosen, RC-elements are connected in series to model the
transient behaviour of the battery.<br/>
Both models can be used for a single cell <code>Ns = Np = 1</code>
as well as a stack built from identical cells.<br/>
Note that the total inner resistance <code>Ri</code> is the sum of
the resistance of resistor <code>r0</code> and the sum of the
resistances of the resistors of the RC-elements.</p>
<p>Additionally to these batteries that model a single cell scaled
by the number of series connected cells <code>Ns</code> and the
number of parallel connected cells <code>Np</code>, single cell
models and stacks are provided in <a href="Modelica.Electrical.Batteries.BatteryStacksWithSensors.html">
BatteryStacksWithSensors</a>. The cells are equipped with sensors,
the measured signals are provided in the <a href="Modelica.Electrical.Batteries.Interfaces.CellBus.html">CellBus</a>.
The stack models contain a matrix of <code>Ns</code> x
<code>Np</code> single cells which can be parameterized differently
to investigate the influence of a degraded cell on the behaviour of
the whole stack, as well as to design battery management systems.
The stack provides the <a href="Modelica.Electrical.Batteries.Interfaces.StackBus.html">StackBus</a>
which contains <code>Ns</code> x <code>Np</code> cell buses of the
cells. Additionally, the signals of the whole stack - the same
signals as of a single cell - are provided in the BatteryBus.</p>
<p>There are two options of series and parallel connections of
cells in stacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>useAllParallelConnections=true</code> : <code>Np</code>
cells are connected in parallel, and these groups are connected in
series.</li>
<li><code>useAllParallelConnections=false</code>: <code>Ns</code>
cells are connected in series, and these groups are connected in
parallel.</li>
</ul>
<p>For convenience, a block <a href="Modelica.Electrical.Batteries.Utilities.BusTranscription.html">
BusTranscription</a> transfers the signals of all cell buses in the
stack bus to the <a href="Modelica.Electrical.Batteries.Interfaces.StackBusArrays.html">
StackBusArrays</a>, arranged as <code>Ns</code> x <code>Np</code>
matrix per measurement signal.</p>
<p>For details of parameterization, see <a href="Modelica.Electrical.Batteries.UsersGuide.Parameterization.html">
UsersGuide.Parameterization</a>.</p>
