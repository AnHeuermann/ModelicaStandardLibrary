<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Only a few components of the Rotational library use the der(…)
operator and are therefore candidates to have states. Most
important, component <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Components.Inertia.html">Inertia</a>
defines the absolute rotation angle and the absolute angular
velocity of this component as candidate for states. In the
"Advanced" menu the built-in StateSelect enumeration can be set to
define the priority to use these variables as states. Without
further action, in most cases a tool will select these variables as
states.</p>
<p>For positioning drive trains where the goal is to position a
load (e.g. the drive train of a robot, or of an elevator), the
absolute angles of the components are bounded, and the issue
discussed below is not present.</p>
<p>For drive trains where the goal is to control the velocity of a
load (e.g. the drive train of a vehicle or the crank angle of an
engine), the absolute angles of the components are quickly
increasing during operation. This is critical, because then the
step size control of time integrators might no longer work
appropriately.</p>
<p>Integrators with step size control adjust their time step size
automatically to meet user defined error bounds ("tolerances").
Typically the local error estimate <var>EST<sub>i</sub></var> is
compared with a mixed bound for absolute and relative errors.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
EST_i ≤ abstol_i + reltol_i*|x_i|
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Here, <var>abstol<sub>i</sub></var> and
<var>reltol<sub>i</sub></var> denote the bounds for the absolute
and relative error of state variable <var>x<sub>i</sub></var>,
respectively. This mixed error bound is used since it is more
robust than a pure relative error based error bound if the nominal
value <var>x<sub>i</sub></var> is (very) close to 0. In a
Modelica simulation model, typically the same relative tolerance
<var>reltol</var> is used for all states and the absolute
tolerances are computed using the relative tolerance and the
nominal values of the states:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
reltol_i = reltol
abstol_i = reltol*x_i(nominal)*0.01
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This error control fails if the state variable
<var>x<sub>i</sub></var> grows without bounds (such as for a drive
train or the crank angle of a vehicle), since then the allowed
error also grows without bounds. The effect is that the error
control on this variable is practically switched off. The correct
way to handle this would be to set
<var>reltol<sub>i</sub></var> = 0 on such a state
variable and only use an absolute tolerance for the step size
control.</p>
<p>At the time of the library design, there was not yet a
possibility to provide this information in Modelica. In order to
reduce this effect, it is advisable to not use absolute angles, but
relative angles as states. A user can define relative variables as
states explicitly with component <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Components.RelativeStates.html">
RelativeStates</a>. Furthermore, all compliant components, such as
<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Components.SpringDamper.html">SpringDamper</a>
are defining the relative angle and the relative angular velocity
as preferred states. Therefore, a tool will select in most cases
relative angles as states.</p>
<p>The relative angles of compliant components are usually small.
For example, the deformation of a typical elastic component is in
the order of 1e-4 rad. Without further action, the error
control would not work properly on variables that are so small (so
often switching the error control off). The remedy is to define
explicitly a nominal value on the relative angle. This definition
is provided in the "Advanced" menu of the compliant components with
parameter "phi_nominal". The default value is 1e-4 rad, to be
in the order of a compliant deformation of a drive. For some
components, like a <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Components.Clutch.html">Clutch</a>,
this might be too small and a value of
phi_nominal = 1 rad might be more appropriate (a
value of phi_nominal = 1e-4 rad does not hurt, but
just makes the error control unnecessarily stringent).</p>
