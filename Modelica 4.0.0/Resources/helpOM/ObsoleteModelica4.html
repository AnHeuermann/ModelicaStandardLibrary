<p>This package contains models and blocks from the Modelica
Standard Library version 3.2.3 that are no longer available in
version 4.0.0 The conversion script for version 4.0.0 changes
references in existing user models automatically to the models and
blocks of package ObsoleteModelica4. The user should
<strong>manually</strong> replace all references to
ObsoleteModelica4 in his/her models to the models that are
recommended in the documentation of the respective model.</p>
<p>In most cases, this means that a model with the name
"ObsoleteModelica4.XXX" should be renamed to "Modelica.XXX"
(version 4.0.0) and then a manual adaptation is needed. For
example, a reference to
ObsoleteModelica4.Math.Matrices.LAPACK.dgeqpf should be replaced by
Modelica.Math.Matrices.LAPACK.dgeqp3 (version 4.0.0). This usually
requires some changes at the place where the class is used (besides
the renaming of the underlying class).</p>
<p>The models in ObsoleteModelica4 are either not according to the
Modelica Language version 3.4 and higher, or the model was changed
to get a better design. In all cases, an automatic conversion to
the new implementation was not feasible, since too complicated.</p>
<p>In order to easily detect obsolete models and blocks, all of
them are specially marked in the icon layer with a red box.</p>
