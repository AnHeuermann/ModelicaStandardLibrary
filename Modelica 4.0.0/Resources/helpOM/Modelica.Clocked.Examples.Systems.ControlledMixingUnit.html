<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Since a long time, Modelica is used to model advanced nonlinear
control systems. Especially, Modelica allows a semi-automatic
treatment of inverse nonlinear plant models. In the fundamental
article (Looye et.al. 2005, see <a href="Modelica.Clocked.UsersGuide.Literature.html">Literature</a>
or <a href="https://www.modelica.org/events/Conference2005/online_proceedings/Session3/Session3c3.pdf">
Download</a>) this approach is described and several controller
structures are presented to utilize an inverse plant model in the
controller. This approach is attractive because it results in a
systematic procedure to design a controller for the whole operating
range of a plant. This is in contrast to standard controller design
techniques that usually design a linear controller for a plant
model that is linearized at a specific operating point. Therefore
the operating range of such controllers is inherently limited.</p>
<p>Up to Modelica 3.2, controllers with inverse plant models can
only be defined as continuous-time systems. Via the export
mechanism of a Modelica tool they could be exported with solvers
embedded in the code and then used as sampled data system in other
environments. However, it is not possible to re-import the sampled
data system to Modelica.</p>
<p>The synchronous features of Modelica 3.3 together with the
Modelica.Clocked library offer now completely new possibilities, so
that the inverse model can be designed and evaluated as sampled
data system within Modelica and a Modelica simulation environment.
This approach is shown at hand of a simple example using a
nonlinear plant model of a mixing unit (FÃ¶llinger O. (1998):
Nichtlineare Regelungen I, Oldenbourg Verlag, 8. Auflage, page 279)
and utilizing this plant model as nonlinear feed-forward controller
according to (Looye et.al. 2005):</p>
<p>A substance A is flowing continuously into a mixing reactor. Due
to a catalyst, the substance reacts and splits into several base
substances that are continuously removed. The reaction generates
energy and therefore the reactor is cooled with a cooling medium.
The cooling temperature T_c(t) in [K] is the primary actuation
signal. Substance A is described by its concentration c(t) in
[mol/l] and its temperature T(t) in [K]. The concentration c(t) is
the signal to be primarily controlled and the temperature T(t) is
the signal that is measured. These equations are collected together
in input/output block <a href="Modelica.Clocked.Examples.Systems.Utilities.ComponentsMixingUnit.MixingUnit.html">
Utilities.ComponentsMixingUnit.MixingUnit</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="ControlledMixingUnit_PlantModel.png" src="../../../Modelica%204.0.0/Resources/Images/Clocked/Examples/ControlledMixingUnit_PlantModel.png"/></p>
<p>The design of the control system proceeds now in the following
steps:</p>
<h4>Pre-Filter</h4>
<p>Inverting a model usually means that equations need to be
symbolically differentiated and that higher derivatives of the
inputs are needed (that are usually not available). One approach is
to filter the inputs, so that a Modelica tool can determine the
derivatives of the filtered input from the filter states. The
minimum needed filter order is determined by first inverting the
continuous-time plant model from the variable to be primarily
controlled (here: "c") to the actuator input (here: "T_c"). This is
performed with the help of block <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Math.InverseBlockConstraints.html">Modelica.Blocks.Math.InverseBlockConstraints</a>
that allows connecting an external input to an output in the
pre-filter design block <a href="Modelica.Clocked.Examples.Systems.Utilities.ComponentsMixingUnit.FilterOrder.html">
Utilities.ComponentsMixingUnit.FilterOrder</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="ControlledMixingUnit_FilterDesign.png" src="../../../Modelica%204.0.0/Resources/Images/Clocked/Examples/ControlledMixingUnit_FilterDesign.png"/></p>
<p>Translating this model will generate the continuous-time inverse
plant model. However, a Modelica tool will give an error message
that it has to differentiate the model, but this requires the
<strong>second derivative</strong> of the external input c_ref and
this derivative is not available. The conclusion is that a low pass
filter of at least second order has to be connected between c_ref
and c, for example <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.Filter.html">Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.Filter</a>.
Only filter types should be used that do not have "vibrations" in
the time domain for a step input. Therefore, parameter
<strong>analogFilter</strong> of the component should be selected
as <strong>CriticalDamping</strong> (= only real poles), or
<strong>Bessel</strong> (= nearly no vibrations, but steeper
frequency response as CriticalDamping). The cut-off frequency
<strong>f_cut</strong> is manually selected by simulations of the
closed loop system. In the example, a CriticalDamping filter of
third order (the third order is selected to get smoother signals)
and a cut-off frequency of 1/300 Hz is used.</p>
<h4>Design of Controller</h4>
<p>The controller for the mixing unit is shown in the diagram layer
of block at hand, as well as in the following figure:</p>
<p><img alt="ControlledMixingUnit_Controller.png" src="../../../Modelica%204.0.0/Resources/Images/Clocked/Examples/ControlledMixingUnit_Controller.png"/></p>
<p>It consists of the filter discussed above. The input to the
filter is the reference concentration which is filtered by the low
pass filter. The output of the filter is used as input to the
concentration c in the inverse plant model. This model computes the
desired cooling temperature T_c (which is used as desired cooling
temperature at the output of the controller) and the desired
temperature T (which is used as desired value for the feedback
controller). This part of the control system is the "feed-forward"
part that computes the desired actuator signal. As feedback
controller a simple P-Controller with one gain is used.</p>
<p>This controller could be defined as continuous-time system in
previous Modelica versions. However, with Modelica 3.3 it is now
also possible to define the controller as sampled data system. For
this, the two inputs are sampled (sample1 and sample2) and the
actuator output is hold (hold1). The controller partition is then
associated with a periodic clock (via sample2) that has a sample
period of 1 s and a solverMethod = "ExplicitEuler". Since the
controller partition is a continuous-time system, it is discretized
and solved with an explicit Euler method at every clock tick (by
integrating from the previous to the actual time instant of the
clock).</p>
<h4>Simulation Results</h4>
<p>The controller works perfectly if the same parameters for the
plant and the inverse plant model are used (follows perfectly the
filtered reference concentration). Changing all parameters of the
inverse plant model by 50 % (with exception of parameter
<strong>e</strong> since the plant is very sensitive to it) still
results in a reasonable control behavior as shown in the next two
figures:</p>
<p><img alt="ControlledMixingUnit_Result.png" src="../../../Modelica%204.0.0/Resources/Images/Clocked/Examples/ControlledMixingUnit_Result.png"/></p>
<p>The green curve in the upper window is the (clocked) output of
the filter, that is, it is the desired concentration. The red curve
in the upper window is the concentration of model mixingUnit, which
is the concentration in the plant. Obviously, the concentration
follows reasonably well the desired one. By using a more involved
feedback controller, the control error could be substantially
reduced.</p>
