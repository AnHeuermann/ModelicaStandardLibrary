<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This component models a <strong>brake</strong>, i.e., a
component where a frictional torque is acting between the housing
and a flange and a controlled normal force presses the flange to
the housing in order to increase friction. The normal force fn has
to be provided as input signal f_normalized in a normalized form (0
≤ f_normalized ≤ 1), fn = fn_max*f_normalized, where fn_max has to
be provided as parameter. Friction in the brake is modelled in the
following way:</p>
<p>When the absolute angular velocity "w" is not zero, the friction
torque is a function of the velocity dependent friction coefficient
mu(w), of the normal force "fn", and of a geometry constant "cgeo"
which takes into account the geometry of the device and the
assumptions on the friction distributions:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
frictional_torque = <strong>cgeo</strong> * <strong>mu</strong>(w) * <strong>fn</strong>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Typical values of coefficients of friction
<strong>mu</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.2 … 0.4 for dry operation,</li>
<li>0.05 … 0.1 when operating in oil.</li>
</ul>
<p>When plates are pressed together, where <strong>ri</strong> is
the inner radius, <strong>ro</strong> is the outer radius and
<strong>N</strong> is the number of friction interfaces, the
geometry constant is calculated in the following way under the
assumption of a uniform rate of wear at the interfaces:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>cgeo</strong> = <strong>N</strong>*(<strong>r0</strong> + <strong>ri</strong>)/2
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The positive part of the friction characteristic
<strong>mu</strong>(w), w &gt;= 0, is defined via table mu_pos
(first column = w, second column = mu). Currently, only linear
interpolation in the table is supported.</p>
<p>When the absolute angular velocity becomes zero, the elements
connected by the friction element become stuck, i.e., the absolute
angle remains constant. In this phase the friction torque is
calculated from a torque balance due to the requirement, that the
absolute acceleration shall be zero. The elements begin to slide
when the friction torque exceeds a threshold value, called the
maximum static friction torque, computed via:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
frictional_torque = <strong>peak</strong> * <strong>cgeo</strong> * <strong>mu</strong>(w=0) * <strong>fn</strong>   (<strong>peak</strong> &gt;= 1)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This procedure is implemented in a "clean" way by state events
and leads to continuous/discrete systems of equations if friction
elements are dynamically coupled. The method is described in (see
also a short sketch in <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.UsersGuide.ModelingOfFriction.html">

<p>More precise friction models take into account the elasticity of
the material when the two elements are "stuck", as well as other
effects, like hysteresis. This has the advantage that the friction
element can be completely described by a differential equation
without events. The drawback is that the system becomes stiff
(about 10-20 times slower simulation) and that more material
constants have to be supplied which requires more sophisticated
identification. For more details, see the following references,
