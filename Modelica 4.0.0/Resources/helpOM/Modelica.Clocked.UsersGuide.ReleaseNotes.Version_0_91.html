<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>First version of the library provided on the Modelica web page.
Changes with respect to version 0.9:</p>
<ul>
<li>The library has been slightly restructured.</li>
<li>Documentation has been significantly enhanced (nearly all
elements of the library are documented now).</li>
<li>Simple examples have been added for many blocks of the library
in the new package <a href="Modelica.Clocked.Examples.Elementary.html">Examples.Elementary</a>.
These blocks have been used to generate the figures in the
documentation of many blocks. Furthermore, they are used for
testing these blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The library has been tested with Dymola 2013 FD01:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Check" with "Pedantic = true" is successful (so the library
should be completely compatible to the Modelica 3.3
specification).</li>
<li>"Check with Simulation" is successful.</li>
<li>The tests have a class coverage of 100 % (that is every class
of the library is utilized in at least one test).</li>
<li>The results of the test models have been either manually
checked, or compared with results of the
Modelica_LinearSystems.Controller or the Modelica.Blocks.Discrete
library.</li>
</ul>
<p>The library has also been tested with the MapleSim Standalone
Modelica parser (so also another Modelica tool deduces that the
library is fully compliant to Modelica).</p>
