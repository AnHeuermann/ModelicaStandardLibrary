<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Only a few components of the Translational library use the
der(…) operator and are therefore candidates to have states. Most
important, component <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Components.Mass.html">Mass</a>
defines the absolute position and the absolute velocity of this
component as candidate for states. In the "Advanced" menu the
built-in StateSelect enumeration can be set to define the priority
to use these variables as states. Without further action, in most
cases a tool will select these variables as states.</p>
<p>For positioning drive trains where the goal is to position a
load, the absolute positions of the components are bounded, and the
issue discussed below is not present.</p>
<p>For drive trains where the goal is to control the velocity of a
load, the absolute positions of the components are quickly
increasing during operation. This is critical, because then the
step size control of time integrators might no longer work
appropriately.</p>
<p>Integrators with step size control adjust their time step size
automatically to meet user defined error bounds ("tolerances").
Typically the local error estimate <var>EST<sub>i</sub></var> is
compared with a mixed bound for absolute and relative errors.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
EST_i ≤ abstol_i + reltol_i*|x_i|
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Here, <var>abstol<sub>i</sub></var> and
<var>reltol<sub>i</sub></var> denote the bounds for the absolute
and relative error of state variable <var>x<sub>i</sub></var>,
respectively. This mixed error bound is used since it is more
robust than a pure relative error based error bound if the nominal
value <var>x<sub>i</sub></var> is (very) close to 0. In a
Modelica simulation model, typically the same relative tolerance
<var>reltol</var> is used for all states and the absolute
tolerances are computed using the relative tolerance and the
nominal values of the states:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
reltol_i = reltol
abstol_i = reltol*x_i(nominal)*0.01
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This error control fails if the state variable
<var>x<sub>i</sub></var> grows without bounds (such as for a drive
train), since then the allowed error also grows without bounds. The
effect is that the error control on this variable is practically
switched off. The correct way to handle this would be to set
<var>reltol<sub>i</sub></var> = 0 on such a state
variable and only use an absolute tolerance for the step size
control.</p>
<p>At the time of the library design, there was not yet a
possibility to provide this information in Modelica. In order to
reduce this effect, it is advisable to not use absolute positions,
but relative positions as states. A user can define relative
variables as states explicitly with component <a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Components.RelativeStates.html">
RelativeStates</a>. Furthermore, all compliant components, such as
<a href="Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.Components.SpringDamper.html">
SpringDamper</a> are defining the relative position and the
relative velocity as preferred states. Therefore, a tool will
select in most cases relative positions as states.</p>
<p>The relative positions of compliant components are usually
small. Without further action, the error control would not work
properly on variables that are so small (so often switching the
error control off). The remedy is to define explicitly a nominal
value on the relative position. This definition is provided in the
"Advanced" menu of the compliant components with parameter
"s_nominal". The default value is 1e-4 m, to be in the order
of a compliant deformation of a drive.</p>
