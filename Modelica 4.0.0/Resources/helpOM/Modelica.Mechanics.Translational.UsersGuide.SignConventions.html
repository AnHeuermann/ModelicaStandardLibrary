<p>The variables of a component of this library can be accessed in
the usual way. However, since most of these variables are basically
elements of <strong>vectors</strong>, i.e., have a direction, the
question arises how the signs of variables shall be interpreted.
The basic idea is explained at hand of the following figure:</p>
<div><img alt="drive2" src="../../../Modelica%204.0.0/Resources/Images/Mechanics/Translational/UsersGuide/drive2.png"/></div>
<p>First, one has to define a <strong>positive</strong> direction
of this line, called <strong>axis of movement</strong>. In the top
of the figure this is characterized by an arrow and a corresponding
text. The simple rule is now: If a variable of a component is
positive and can be interpreted as the element of a vector (e.g.,
force or velocity vector), the corresponding vector is directed
into the positive direction of the axis of movement. In the
following figure, the right-most mass of the figure above is
displayed with the positive vector direction displayed according to
this rule:</p>
<div><img alt="drive3" src="../../../Modelica%204.0.0/Resources/Images/Mechanics/Translational/UsersGuide/drive3.png"/></div>
<p>The cut-force <code>mass2.flange_a.f</code> of the right mass is
directed into the direction of movement if the values are positive.
Similarly, the velocity <code>mass2.v</code> of the right mass is
also directed into the direction of movement if the values are
positive</p>
