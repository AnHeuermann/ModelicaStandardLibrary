<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Educational example of a magnetic circuit containing a toroidal
iron core with rectangular cross section and an airgap:</p>
<p>A current ramp is applied in positive electric direction through
the exciting coil, causing a rising magnetomotive force (mmf) in
positive magnetic direction of the electromagnetic converter. The
mmf in turn causes a magnetic flux through the circuit in the
direction indicated by the flux sensor. From that magnetic flux,
flux density can be calculated in every element of the magnetic
circuit. Flux density is used to derive magnetic field strength.
Magnetic field strength times length of the flux line gives
magnetic potential difference of each element. The sum of all
magnetic potential differences is covered by the mmf of the
exciting coil.</p>
<p>Using the values shown in section Parameters, the results can be
validated easily by analytic calculations:</p>

<p>Note that since no leakage is present, the magnetic flux is the
same in every element - they are connected in series. For
calculation of the length of flux lines, a medium flux line is
used.</p>
<p>Additionally, a measuring coil is placed in the airgap. Due to
Faraday's law, the time derivative of flux causes an induced
voltage both in the exciting coil (in positive direction) and in
the measuring coil (in negative direction). Since current and
therefore flux are a linear time dependent ramp, induced voltages
are constant during that ramp and zero otherwise. Note that usage
of nonlinear magnetic material would change that result due the
nonlinear relationship between magnetic field strength and flux
density.</p>
<p>Note the proper usage of electric and magnetic grounds to define
zero potential.</p>
