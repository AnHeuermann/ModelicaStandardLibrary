<h2><a id="info" name="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>A central element of the Modelica.Clocked library is a
<strong>clock</strong>. Below, the most important information for
clocks is summarized. For more details, see the Modelica Language
Specification, Chapter 16 (for Modelica Language Version ≥
3.3).</p>
<p>A <strong>Clock</strong> type is a base data type (introduced in
Modelica 3.3, additionally to Real, Integer, Boolean, String) that
defines when a particular partition consisting of a set of
equations is active. Starting with Modelica Language Version 3.3,
every variable and every equation is either continuous-time or is
associated exactly to one clock. This feature is visualized in the
figure below where c(ti) is a clock that is active at particular
time instants ti and r(ti) is a variable that is associated to this
clock. A clocked variable has only a value when the corresponding
clock is active:</p>
<p><img alt="Clock variables and clocked variables" src="../../../Modelica%204.0.0/Resources/Images/Clocked/Clocks/clockSignals.png"/></p>
<p>Similarly to RealInput, RealOutput etc., clock input and output
connectors, called ClockInput and ClockOutput, are defined in
sublibrary <a href="Modelica.Clocked.ClockSignals.Interfaces.html">ClockSignal.Interfaces</a>
in order to propagate clocks via connections. A clock signal can be
generated with one of the blocks of sublibrary <a href="Modelica.Clocked.ClockSignals.Clocks.html">ClockSignals.Clocks</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Sublibrary ClockSignals.Clocks" src="../../../Modelica%204.0.0/Resources/Images/Clocked/Clocks/clocks.png"/></p>
<p>The output signals of the blocks in the above figure are clock
signals, by default visualized with dotted grey lines.</p>
<p>With the blocks of sublibrary <a href="Modelica.Clocked.ClockSignals.Sampler.html">ClockSignals.Sampler</a>
a clock signal can be sub-sampled, super-sampled, or shift-sampled
to generate a new clock signal. For example, with the following
model, a periodic clock signal of 0.1 s is sub-sampled with a
factor 3 and therefore a clock signal with a period of 0.3 s is
generated:</p>
<p><img alt="Sub-sample example model" src="../../../Modelica%204.0.0/Resources/Images/Clocked/Clocks/subSampledClockExample.png"/><br/>
<img alt="Sub-sample example plot" src="../../../Modelica%204.0.0/Resources/Images/Clocked/Clocks/subSampledClockResult.png"/></p>
<p>As usual in synchronous languages, a clock is represented by a
<strong>true</strong> value when the clock is active. The
relationship between such derived clocks is <strong>exact</strong>,
so it is guaranteed that at every 3rd tick of clock
"periodicRealClock.y", the clock "subSample.y" is active.</p>
<p>If a clock is associated to a clocked continuous-time partition,
then an <strong>integrator</strong> has to be defined that is used
to integrate the partition from the previous to the current clock
tick. This is performed by setting parameter
<strong>useSolver</strong> = <strong>true</strong> and defining the
integration method as String with parameter
<strong>solver</strong>. Both parameters are in tab
<strong>Advanced</strong> of one of the clock signal generating
blocks. The possible integration methods are tool dependent. It is
expected that at least the solvers "External" (= use the integrator
selected in the simulation environment) and "ExplicitEuler" (=
explicit Euler method) are supported by every tool. For an example,
see <a href="Modelica.Clocked.Examples.Systems.ControlledMixingUnit.html">
Examples.Systems.ControlledMixingUnit</a>.</p>
<p>A clocked partition is a set of equations that depend on each
other and where the boundary variables are marked with sample and
hold operators. If a clocked partition contains no operator
<strong>der</strong>, <strong>delay</strong>,
<strong>spatialDistribution</strong>, no event related operators
(with exception of <strong>noEvent</strong>(…)), and no
<strong>when</strong>-clause with a Boolean condition, it is a
<strong>clocked discrete-time</strong> partition, that is, it is a
standard sampled data system that is described by difference
equations. If a clocked partition is <strong>not</strong> a
<strong>clocked discrete-time</strong> partition and it contains
neither operator <strong>previous</strong> nor operator
<strong>interval</strong>, it is a <strong>clocked discretized
continuous-time</strong> partition. Such a partition has to be
solved with a <strong>solver</strong> method. It is an error, if
none of the two properties hold, e.g., if operators
<strong>previous</strong> and <strong>der</strong> are both used in
the same partition. In a clocked discrete-time partition all event
generating mechanisms do no longer apply. Especially neither
relations, nor one of the built-in event triggering operators will
trigger an event.</p>
